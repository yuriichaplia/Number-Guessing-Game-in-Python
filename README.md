# Number-Guessing-Game-in-Python

This is a simple command-line number guessing game written in Python.  
The computer selects a random number between 1 and 100, and your goal is to guess it within a limited number of attempts.

## How to Play
1. Run the script.
2. Choose a difficulty level:  
   - `easy` gives you 10 attempts  
   - `hard` gives you 5 attempts
3. Enter your guesses.  
   You'll get hints after each guess:
   - "Too high"
   - "Too low"
4. The game ends when you guess the number or run out of attempts.

## Features
- Difficulty selection (`easy` / `hard`)
- Input validation for non-numeric guesses
- Random number generation between 1 and 100
- Feedback after each guess
